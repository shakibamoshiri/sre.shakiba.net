## What is or are differences between DevOps and SRE?
First
- DevOps is community approach to help software operation be **agile**
- SRE is Google approach to do so

Second
- DevOps' focus is more on concepts and specially **culture** and it is one of DevOps pillars (CAMS Model)
    - **C** Culture
    - **A** Automation
    - **M** Measure and Metrics
    - **S** Sharing (= Knowledge Sharing)
- SRE's focus is more and practicality of being Agile in operation.

## Agile versus Scrum / XP / Kanban
As an analogy you can think of DevOps as set of rules and manifesto while SRE is an implementation of DevOps. And this is the reason Google says:
> class SRE implements DevOps
